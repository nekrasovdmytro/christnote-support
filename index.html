    <h1>Privacy Policy for ChristNote</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 2025</p>
    
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>ChristNote ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</strong></p>
    <p>ChristNote is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect any personal data</li>
        <li>Track your usage</li>
        <li>Share information with third parties</li>
        <li>Use analytics or tracking services</li>
        <li>Store data on external servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Notes Storage</h2>
    <p>All notes created in ChristNote are stored <strong>exclusively on your device</strong>. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your notes never leave your device</li>
        <li>No data is sent to external servers</li>
        <li>No cloud synchronization occurs</li>
        <li>You have complete control over your data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can export your notes at any time using the Export feature in Settings.</p>

    <h2>Web Notes Feature</h2>
    <p>ChristNote allows you to connect to external web-based note-taking services (Web Notes feature). When you use this feature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You provide the URL of the web service you want to access</li>
        <li>The app displays the web service in a browser view</li>
        <li>We do not access, store, or process content from external web services</li>
        <li>The privacy practices of external web services are governed by their own privacy policies</li>
        <li>Please review the privacy policy of any web service you choose to connect to</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Export</h2>
    <p>You can export your local notes at any time using the Export feature in the app's Settings. Exported notes can be saved with or without encryption, and you maintain full control over where and how you store exported data.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>ChristNote does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The app uses standard iOS frameworks and does not include any third-party SDKs that collect data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>ChristNote is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect information from children because we do not collect information from anyone.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the support information provided in the App Store listing.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any data, there is no data for us to share, delete, or modify. All your data remains on your device under your complete control.</p>

    <hr>
    <p><small>This privacy policy applies to ChristNote version 1.0 and later.</small></p>
